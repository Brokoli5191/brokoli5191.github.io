                        <b>General Remarks:</b> The basic idea of comparison geometry is to compare the geometry of an arbitrary Riemannian manifold M with the geometry of constant curvature spaces
                        (flat space, the spheres and hyperbolic spaces) to obtain information on the properties of M. To give a vivid description recall that triangles on a sphere are fatter than
                        triangles in flat space and that the sum of interior angles of a spherical triangle generally exceeds Pi. A typical statement in comparison geometry would now be that if M has
                        (sectional) curvature bounded below by some k>0 then the triangles of M are fatter than those of M_k, the sphere of curvature k. <br /><br />

                        The theory that is bulit upon such and similar ideas has lead to a wealth of important results that firmly belong to the standard tool-kit of Riemannian geometry. In
                        particular, this includes some of the most important theorems, which allow to obtain global information on the geometry and topology of Riemannian manifolds.

                  <b>Contents and prerequsites:</b> This course provides an introduction to comparison geometry maninly of Riemannian manifolds with some excursions into the semi-Riemannian/Lorentzian
                  realm. We present the main results and discuss the main techniques of the theory assuming basic knowledge in Riemannian geometry (as provided by a typical standard course, see e.g.
                  our <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~stein/teaching/SoSem16/rg-2017-03-06.pdf">lecture notes</a>) and of course basic konwledge of differential geometry (again as provided by a
                  typical first course, see e.g. the <a href="http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~mike/teaching/ss08/dg.pdf"> lecture notes</a> of Mike Kunzinger). In addidtion we will use some basics on
                  covering spaces and also some ODE-theory. <br /><br />

                  We will, however, start the course by discussing some fundamentals of Riemannian geometry (to also allow students from different curricula as e.g. theoretical physics to enter the
                  course) such as geodesics, the exponential map, geodesic variations and Jacobi fields. As a first result we will prove <b>Myers' theorem</b> which states that a (complete, conected)
                  Riemannian manifold with Ricci-curvature bounded below by a positive constant is compact with an explicit bound on its diameter and a finite fundamental group. A further fundamental
                  result we will present is the <b>Rauch comparison theorem</b>, which relates the sectional curvature to the rate at which geodesics spread apart. Finally we will prove
                  <b>Toponogov's triangle comparison theorem</b> which is a precise version of the idea mentined above. <br /><br />

                  <b>Target audience</b> are primarily students in the mathematics master programme (specialising in geometry and topology) but also ambitious students in the theoretical physics
                  master programme. <br /><br />

                  <b>Position in the curriculum:</b> Master Mathematics, compulsary module "Electives in Geometry" code MGEV. This course is also part of the
                  <a href="https://mcmp.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">Vienna Master Class Mathematical Physics</a>. <br /><br />

                  <b>Literature, reading list:</b> This course is strongly influenced by Stefan Haller's lecture notes
                  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~stefan/DGIII2011.html">Differential Geometry III</a>
                  and a previous <a target="_blank" href="https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=250116&semester=2013S">lecture course</a> by Michael Kunzinger. Further standard sources are:
