              <h3>General introduction:</h3>
              <p>The theory of pseudodifferential operators emerged in the mid 1960-ies through the work of Kohn and Nirenberg and
              has earlier roots in Fourier analysis and singular integrals. It was subsequently refined by a number of mathematicians, most notably by <a 
              href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Hormander.html" 
              target="_blank">Lars HÃ¶rmander</a>, and turned into one of the most
              esstential tools in PDE. More precisely, it allows a flexible way of
              applying Fourier techniques to the study of variable-coefficient operators
              and singularities of distributions. By the latter we mean the wave front set, a
              refinement of the notion of singular support, in the sense that also the 
              the "bad frequency directions'' of the distribution are taken into account---the
              study of which is called microlocal analysis.</p>
              
              <p>Applications of pseudodifferential operators are multitude. The most 
              prominent and classical is the propagation of the wave front set for 
              solutions of partial differential equations. However, over the years, 
              in particular pseudodifferential calculus has turned into a general method that
              has successfully been applied in diverse fields of analysis, recently also
              in time frequency analysis.</p>

              <h3>Contents:</h3>
              <p>At leat for the first three quarters of the course we
              will rather closely follow the book <i>Elementary Introduction to the Theory
              of Pseudodifferential Operators</i> by Xavier Saint Raymond (Studies in
              Mathematics, CRC-Press, Boca Raton, 1991). The main chapters will be:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><i>0. Motivation and Introduction</i></li>
                <li><i>1. Prerequisites:</i> A short collection of the basic
                facts on Fourier transform and Sobolev spaces.</li>
                <li><i>2. Pseudodifferential Symbols:</i> Symbols and their asymptotic expansions,
                oscillatory integrals, operations on symbols.</li>
                <li><i>3. Pseudodifferential operators:</i> definition and action in
                S, S', and H^s, change of variables.</li>
                <li><i>4. Applications:</i> local solvability of linear PDEs, 
                microlocal analysis, propagation of singularities, ...</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Literature:</h3>
              <p>A short commented list of books may be found
              <a href="pseudo_lit.pdf">here</a>.</p>
              
              <h3>What you already should know:</h3>
              <p>A solid background in analysis is indispensable. Further you need to be 
              aquainted with distibution theory (approximately the contents of a 3-4 
              hours course, in particular tempered distributions, 
              Fourier transform on S' and L^2, Sobolev spaces based on L^2--- 
              there will be, however, a short and terse account on 
              these topics (Ch. 1) to refresh your memory). You will also appreciate some
              basic background from topology, functional analysis (Lebesgue spaces) and
              PDE (classical equations).</p>
              
              <h3>Target audience:</h3>
              <p>This course is designed
              for the doctoral college (IK) <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at/nuhag-php/ik/"
              target="_blank">
              Mathematical Analysis and Applications:
               Time-frequency Analysis and Microlocal Analysis</a> and can be seen
              as a continuation of my course on <a href="../SoSem06/distr.html" target="_blank">
              distribution theory</a> from summer term 2006. Hence it serves both as an 
              element of the PhD curriculum in the framework of the IK as well as a 
              preparation for a dimploma thesis in analysis, in particular with 
              the research group <a href="http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~diana" 
              target="_blank">DiANA</a>.</p>
              
              <h3>Remark:</h3>
              <p>The course will normally be held 4 hours a week but 
              suspended some weeks on (duly) announcement.</p>
