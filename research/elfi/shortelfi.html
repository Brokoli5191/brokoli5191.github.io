We outline the basic properties of an interferometric gravitational wave 
detector in space as a tool for cosmology. Main emphasis is put on a 
frequency range of about 
<IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline85" SRC="img6.gif"  >  to  
<IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline87" SRC="img7.gif"  > Hz, pushing the
sensitivity limit of  
the currently proposed project 
LISA&nbsp;[<A HREF="node1.html#lisa">1</A>] down by two orders of magnitude. 
Thus we expect to detect a variety of cosmological sources&nbsp;
[<A HREF="node1.html#schutz">2</A>,<A HREF="node1.html#thorne">3</A>] 
as opposed to the astrophysical objects accessible to LISA. 
In particular we focus on the observation of supermassive black holes 
(> <IMG WIDTH=21 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline6" SRC="img1.gif"  >
 solar masses) and primordial gravitational wave background.
Sufficient sensitivity in this low frequency range is mainly achieved by 
increasing 
the arm length of the interferometer by two orders of magnitude as compared 
to LISA, i.e. to the order of 1 AU. The main obstacles  are finding a suitable 
orbit and controlling the noise due to thermal fluctuations of the
sun, which must be regarded as the most important 
source of noise in this frequency range.
<P>
The basic idea is to extend the design concept of LISA, i.e. a cluster of
three spacecraft that provide three Michelson interferometers, to the
desired wave lengths. The project we propose is called <STRONG>
Extra Low Frequency
Interferometer (ELFI)</STRONG>.
The possible arm length is limited by the diameter 
of the reflecting mirror, the laser wavelength and the ratio of
the received to the transmitted laser power. 
A detailed analysis shows that we can
even reach an arm length of 3 AU with a mirror of diameter one meter and
a laser wavelenght of 532 nm.
<P>
The next question to ask is, where to put such a big instrument?
A cluster formed by three spacecraft in a heliocentric orbit
at one AU, with relative angles of 120 degrees, phase shifted  20 degrees
with respect to the earth combines two major benefits: 
long equally sized arms and  relative ease of reaching the orbit. 
Mission analysis shows that within approximately 5 
years the final orbit can be reached with a reasonable amount of fuel, 
thereby well fitting into the Ariane 5 payload capability of 3.9 tons.
<P>
Although our configuration of spacecraft is bound to stay in the ecliptic 
plane,
full angular resolution is
possible for ELFI, since the signals associated with each of the two 
different polarization modes of gravitational waves 
show a characteristic pattern of modulation dependent on the position of the
source in the rotating rest-frame of ELFI during the 
period of one year.
<P>
Like with LISA the sensitivity of our detector is limited at high frequencies
by the photon shot noise and the blow up of the geometrical
factor&nbsp;[<A HREF="node1.html#lisa">1</A>]. However,
we expect to have a reasonable signal to noise up to frequencies of about
10 mHz.

<P>

At the low end the
major source of noise comes from spurious accelerations of the proof mass.
The hardest task is to control the radiation pressure caused
by the thermal fluctuations of the sun which becomes the dominant term at a
frequency of about  <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline101" SRC="img10.gif"  > Hz.

<P>

These 
fluctuations can be estimated to be of the order of  <IMG WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline103"
 SRC="img11.gif"  > K. However, such big 
distortions are unacceptable and we have to look for some active temperature 
control strategies as passive ones won't do the trick. 
Therefore we propose to heat
the spacecraft at an amount of several <I>K</I> above the fluctuation peeks,
using a feedback control system that keeps the
temperature constant to an accuracy of  <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline107" SRC="img12.gif"  > K. The
amount of power needed was estimated to approximately 5 W/K, which
seems quite manageable. 
The only drawback comes from the necessity of a high accuracy
temperature measurement at frequencies of 
<IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline101" SRC="img10.gif"  >  Hz. 
Assuming that we can
suppress  <IMG WIDTH=23 HEIGHT=12 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline113" SRC="img13.gif"  >  down to 
<IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline107" SRC="img12.gif"  >  K at these 
frequencies (which goes
beyond present technology) and also gaining one order of magnitude 
from emissivity improvement we  estimate
the strain to be approximately  <IMG WIDTH=38 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline119" SRC="img15.gif"  >  at  <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline101" SRC="img10.gif"  > Hz and approximately
 <IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline123" SRC="img16.gif"  >  at  <IMG WIDTH=31 HEIGHT=15 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="tex2html_wrap_inline87" SRC="img7.gif"  > Hz respectively, which finally gives 
us the sensitivity curve of our instrument for a one year observation time
as shown in Fig. 1.
<P>

We have demonstrated that a Michelson type interferometer with arm lengths
of more than 1 AU indeed seems feasible, although such a project will
probably not be realized within the next 20 years. Nevertheless, we believe
that a comparable instrument will indeed be built in the future and
will contribute substantially to our understanding of the universe.

<STRONG>Figure 1.</STRONG> shows the noise curves of the LISA and ELFI detectors; the
strain amplitude <I>h</I> corresponds to the <I>rms</I> detector noise for a one
year observation. Additionally two possible sources are shown.
