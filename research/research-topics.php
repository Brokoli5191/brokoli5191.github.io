        I was originally trained as a mathematical physicist specializing in general relativity. Over the years I have developed a broad interest in several topics in analysis, geometry and
        mathematical physics, as well as in mathematics education. My current research interests include but are not confined to the following list

      <ul class="list-research">
        <h4 class="about-title">Mathematical General Relativity</h4>
         <li class="list-dot">spacetime singularities & cosmic censorship,</li>
         <li class="list-dot">non-smooth spacetime geometries, and</li>
         <li class="list-dot">exact radiative spacetimes, in particular impulsivge gravitational waves.</li>
      
        <h4 class="about-title">Mathematical Analysis</h4>
         <li class="list-dot">(non-linear) generalized functions,</li>
         <li class="list-dot">the theory of PDEs, in particular kinetic theory, and</li>
         <li class="list-dot">time frequency analysis & modulation spaces.</li>

        Most of my research is carried out within the Austrian Science Fund's (FWF) 
        <b>Emerging Fields project  <a href="https://ef-geometry.univie.ac.at/" target="_blank">A new geometry for Einstein's Theory 
        of Relativity and Beyond</a></b> with my long-term colleague and collaborator <a href="https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~mike" target="_blank">Michael Kunzinger</a>,

        Much of my earlier research was carried out in collaboration with the international research group
        <b>DiANA</b> (which is an acronym for "Differential Algebras and Nonlinear Analysis") based at the Universities of
        <a href="http://www.univie.ac.at" target="_blank">Vienna</a> and <a href="http://www.uibk.ac.at" target="_blank">Innsbruck</a>
        in Austria, the <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en" target="_blank">University of Ghent</a> in Belgium, as well as at the
